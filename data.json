The UKGC enforces strict standards for player protection, fairness, and security.</div></details><details class=\"mb-3 border-b border-white/10 pb-3\"><summary class=\"font-semibold text-lg cursor-pointer py-2\">How do you rate the gaming sites?</summary><div class=\"pt-2 text-text-medium\">Our ratings are based on a comprehensive evaluation process covering factors like game selection, bonus terms and fairness, website usability, mobile compatibility, payment options, withdrawal speed, customer support quality, and security measures.</div></details><details class=\"mb-3 border-b border-white/10 pb-3\"><summary class=\"font-semibold text-lg cursor-pointer py-2\">What are wagering requirements?</summary><div class=\"pt-2 text-text-medium\">Wagering requirements (also called playthrough requirements) specify the amount of money you need to bet before you can withdraw bonus funds or winnings derived from them. For example, a £10 bonus with a 35x wagering requirement means you must bet a total of £350 (£10 * 35) before cashing out the bonus.

However, offers and terms can change rapidly. Always click through to the gaming site and read the full terms and conditions (T&Cs) directly on their platform before claiming any bonus.
